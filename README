This is an implementation of the distributed algorithm for dynamic programming
proposed in the paper “Parallel Design Pattern for Computational Biology and
Scientific Computing Applications” (W Liu, 2003). It contains code that
validates the empirical results presented in the paper and can be used to solve
dynamic programming tasks on a cluster with MPI.

    * report.pdf
      Our project report, the thing you are probably looking for.
    
    * design.pdf
      Our project proposal, explaining in more detail what we set
      out to do with this project.

    * dprunner.py
      The main executable Python program. This is the entry point to
      running the dynamic programming solver.

    * sw.py, nus.py
      Implementations of the parallel programming problem template for
      the Smith-Waterman algorithm and Nussinov algorithm
      respectively.

    * seqs.txt, seqs-small.txt
      Input files for the benchmarks. seqs.txt contains two dummy
      sequences of length 3000 for the quadratic Smith-Waterman
      algorithm. seqs-small.txt contains a 666 character long sequence
      for the cubic Nussinov algorithm. The files are simply strings
      of repeated As, since the content of the sequence does not
      influence the execution path and therefore the benchmarks.

    * times.txt, times2.txt, times3.txt
      Files with results from the benchmarks. times.txt contains a log
      of the raw measurements, while times2.txt and times3.txt are
      processed files created in order to produce the charts seen in
      the report.

How to implement new dynamic programs:
--------------------------------------

    Simply create a new Python script which defines the following
    three functions:
      
      1) load_input(args):
         This function is in charge of loading whatever the input for
         the program is. The parameter args is a list of command line
         arguments passed to the DP solver. It must return a pair
         whose first item can be any appropriate representation of the
         loaded input and whose second item must be the dimensions of
         the DP matrix to be used for this problem.

      2) compute_cell(row, column, table, data):
         The meat of the dynamic program. This function is responsible
         for computing the value of a cell in the DP matrix. row and
         column identify the position of the cell to be computed (both
         zero-based). table is the DP matrix, a 2D NumPy array of
         doubles. data is whatever was returned as the first element
         from load_input.

      3) write_output(args, table, data):
         This function is called on the last worker and is used to
         wrap up the computation. It gets args, the same argument list
         as passed to load_input, the DP matrix with all its elements
         computed (table) and the problem definition data loaded in by
         load_input (data).

How to run the solver:
----------------------

    mpirun -np $procs python dprunner.py -p $program -d $div $args

      where $procs is the number of processes to run, $program is the
      dynamic program to run (a path to sw.py, nus.py or another such
      program), $div is the division parameter of the block-cyclic
      method and $args are the arguments passed to load_input and
      write_output (in the case of sw.py and nus.py, it is a sequence
      of the input file and the output file).

How we ran the benchmarks:
--------------------------

    mpirun -np $procs python dprunner.py -p sw.py -d 1 seqs.txt out.txt
    mpirun -np $procs python dprunner.py -p nus.py -d 1 seqs-small.txt out.txt
    
      with $procs going from 1 to 16.

    mpirun -np $procs python dprunner.py -p nus.py -d $d seqs-small.txt out.txt

      with $procs going from 2 to 16 and $d going through 2, 4, 8, 16,
      32 and 64.
